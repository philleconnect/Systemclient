# Systemclient
This is the background client application for student machines of PhilleConnect. It waites for requests from a teacher machine and will lock the monitor or shutdown the workstation if required. It also controls the VNC server and submitts a screenshot if requested.

# Notice
This is the completely rewritten version 2, written in python.

# How to use this?
This is a part of the PhilleConnect system. To use this application, you'll need at least a PhilleConect Server. We recommend to use the Installer ([Windows](https://github.com/philleconnect/ClientSetup-Windows/releases), [Linux](https://github.com/philleconnect/ClientSetup-Linux/releases)) if you want to use PhilleConnect in a productive environment.

# How to compile this?
First, install Python 3.8 or newer on your system. Then, use the installDependencies.bat to install all required packages using pip3. Now, run compile.bat.
